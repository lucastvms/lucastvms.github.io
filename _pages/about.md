Sharing some of my history: I have almost 9 years in computing and I’m still far away from an expert. I’ve passed all this time only to finally understand what I want to do in this vast area. I’ve decided I want to make the better code I’m capable, in any language, with efficience and share my experience with other programmers and students, hoping that it will help them. Just a tip: don’t fill upset if you’re still lost, take your time doing what you feel it’s fun, experiencing and I can garantee that you will find your answer. If you have any thoughts you want to share, questions or just want to chat more casually you can find me on Telegram at @lucastvms.
