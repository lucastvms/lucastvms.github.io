## What is a Data Structure?
A **Data Structure** (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Why Data Structures?
+ They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
+ They help manage and organize data.
+ They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

It makes the difference between a OK product and an outstanding one.

## Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

### Abstract Data Type
An **Abstract Data Type** (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface dos not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

It remembers a mode of transportation. If we want to go from point A to point B we can do it many ways (DS): biking, walking by car. In the end, to mask the process (ADT) we just put in the points A and B.

### H3 Heading

Here's some basic text

And here's some *italics*

Here's some **bold** text.

What about a [link](https://github.com/lucastvms)

Here's  bulleted list:
* First item
+ Second item
- Third item

Here's a numbered list:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

Python code block:
```python
    import numpy as np

    def test_function(x, y):
      z = np.sum(x, y)
      return z
```

R code block:
```r
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("some_file.csv")
head(df)
```

Here's some inline code `x+y`.

Here's an image:
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/example/post-it.jpg" alt="linearly separable data">

Here's another image using Kramdown:
![alt]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/example/post-it.jpg)

Here's some math:

$$z=x+y$$

You can also put it inline $$z=x+y$$
