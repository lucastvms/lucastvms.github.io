## What is a Data Structure?
A **Data Structure** (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively.

## Why Data Structures?
+ They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms.
+ They help manage and organize data.
+ They make code cleaner and easier to understand.

It makes the difference between a OK product and an outstanding one.

## Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures

### Abstract Data Type
An **Abstract Data Type** (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.

The interface dos not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.

It remember a mode of transportation (vehicle). If we want to go from point A to point B we can do it many ways: biking, walking, by car (DS). In the end, to mask some details, we just put in the points A and B and use the vehicle (ADT).

I really hope that after reading more in this category you understand this demonstration of a Google Coding/Engineering Interview.
